# Sea-Lion-Optimization-SLO-
As part of my university project in Algorithm Analysis, I explored and implemented the Sea Lion Optimization algorithm â€” a novel nature-inspired metaheuristic based on the hunting and social behavior of sea lions. The project involved a detailed study of the algo mechanism, Python-based implementation, and benchmarking against the Sphere function.
